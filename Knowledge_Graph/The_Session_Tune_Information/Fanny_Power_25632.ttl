She heard below\nThe two cocks shaking their wings to crow.\n\"Oh, hush you! hush you! both red and gray,\nOr will you hurry my love away?\"\n(Music part B:)\n\"Oh, hush your crowin', both gray and red,\nOr he will be goin' to join the dead;\nAnd cease you calling his ghost to the mold;\nAnd I'll come crowning your wings with gold.\"\n(Music part A:)\nWhen all but dreaming was Fanny Power,\nA light came streaming beneath her bower;\nAnd on the morrow, when they awoke,\nThey knew that sorrow her heart had broke.\n(Music part B)" ;
